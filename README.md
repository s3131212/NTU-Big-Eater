# NTU Big Eater
It's always a pain to decide what to eat for lunch, so here's the lunch decider for NTU !

## Client
The client is written in C++ using Qt framework. It simply shows a panel to let the users check what they prefer, and the program will randomly choose a restaurant nearby.

If the user want to enjoy lunch with others, he or she can post the request and other users can see it!
